## A Novel Approach to Studying Human Movement
This project explores a low-cost, AI-powered system for analyzing human movement, specifically the throwing motion in baseball. It uses wearable IMU sensors and a BiLSTM neural network with attention to predict pitch velocity and extract biomechanical insights.
